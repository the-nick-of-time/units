    If an identical unit has already been created (defined by same exponents
    and scale) then return that pre-constructed unit. This makes sure that 
    calculations that result in a named unit (such as ohms) will be correctly
    reported as such rather than breaking down into their base components.

    :param scale: How many of the base unit one of this unit is equivalent to.
        Note that the scale factors of the constituent units are not taken into
        account. For instance, even though the conversion factor from meters per
        second to miles per hour could be determined strictly from the scale
        factors already defined for miles -> meters and hours -> seconds, doing
        that calculation is up to the constructor of the unit. I think this
        obeys the principle of least surprise, but I might be wrong.
    :param exponents: A sequence of tuples or dict that pair existing units
        with the exponent they should be raised to.
    :param name: A name to give this unit, like joules. If no particular
        physical name exists, leave it unfilled and a name will be automatically
        constructed using the names of its component units and their exponents.
    :param abbrev: A canonical abbreviation for this unit, like J for joules.
        Officially called the unit's symbol. If no particular one exists, leave
        it unfilled and it will be automatically be constructed using the
        symbols of its base units.
    :param doc: Documentation for this unit, to show in tools like Sphinx.

        measurements with a magnitude.
