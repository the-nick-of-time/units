"""A module for the first-class manipulation of physical quantities.

It is named ``pyunitx`` as a reference to the ``siunitx`` LaTeX package.

Most conversion factors come from
`this document from NIST <https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf>`_.
Most values of constants come from
`this list also from NIST <https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/Table/allascii.txt>`_.

# After the update for automatic conversion functions, this is somewhat less
# important, at least in terms of "not knowing about the conversion functions".
# However, it is still nice to have all the pre-constructed units and dimensions
# with special names available.
