    While the earth is spinning, it is also orbiting the sun. The movement along
    the orbit over the course of the day means that the sun has moved backwards
    a bit so the earth has to do some extra rotation before the sun is in the 
    same place again. If you instead hovered above one of the poles with a fixed
    orientation, and tracked the time it took for the earth to rotate back into
    the same position, you would get the length of the sidereal day. This is a 
    little shorter than a solar day.
